# Hi, I'm Charlie! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Software Engineer**. Ex SpotX, AWS, and ShutterStock. With over 8 years of experience building software for clients and businesses, I'm now exploring the fascinating world of **low-level programming**, **game engines**, and **real-time systems**.

## ðŸŽ® Here's Some Stuff I've Worked On

### [Snake Game](https://github.com/chooie/sdl3_opengl_snake_game)
A cross-platform Snake game built with **C++** and **SDL3**. This is my playground for learning real-time graphics rendering with OpenGL, responsive input handling, and sound integration in native applications.
